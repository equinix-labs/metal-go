  customer_ip:
    description: An IP address from the subnet that will be used on the Customer side. This parameter is optional,
      but if supplied, we will use the other usable IP address in the subnet as the Metal IP. By default,
      the last usable IP address in the subnet will be used.

    description: speed can be passed as integer number representing bps speed or string

    type: integer
  subnet:
    description: The /30 or /31 subnet of one of the VRF IP Blocks that will be used with the VRF for
      the Virtual Circuit. This subnet does not have to be an existing VRF IP reservation, as we
      will create the VRF IP reservation on creation if it does not exist. The Metal IP and Customer
      IP must be IPs from this subnet. For /30 subnets, the network and broadcast IPs cannot be used
      as the Metal or Customer IP. The subnet specified must be contained within an already-defined
      IP Range for the VRF.
