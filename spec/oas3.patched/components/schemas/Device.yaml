      By default, servers at Equinix Metal are configured in a “bonded” mode
      using LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol). Each 2-NIC server is
      configured with a single bond (namely bond0) with both interfaces eth0
      and eth1 as members of the bond in a default Layer 3 mode. Some device
      plans may have a different number of ports and bonds available.

      at a given time. The termination time can also be used to release a
      hardware reservation instance at a given time, keeping the reservation
      open for other uses.  On a spot market device, the termination time will
      be set automatically when outbid.
