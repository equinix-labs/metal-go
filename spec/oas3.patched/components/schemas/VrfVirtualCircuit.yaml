      the last usable IP address in the subnet will be used.

      The status changes of a VRF virtual circuit are generally the same as Virtual Circuits that aren't in a VRF.
      However, for VRF Virtual Circuits on Fabric VCs, the status will change to 'waiting_on_peering_details' once
      the Fabric service token associated with the virtual circuit has been redeemed on Fabric, and Metal has found
      the associated Fabric connection. At this point, users can update the subnet, MD5 password, customer IP and/or
      metal IP accordingly. For VRF Virtual Circuits on Dedicated Ports, we require all peering details to be set on
      creation of a VRF Virtual Circuit. The status will change to `changing_peering_details` whenever an active VRF
      Virtual Circuit has any of its peering details updated.
    # NOTE: Any new additions to the enum will affect users using generated SDKs.

  subnet:
    description: >-
      The /30 or /31 subnet of one of the VRF IP Blocks that will be used with the VRF for
      the Virtual Circuit. This subnet does not have to be an existing VRF IP reservation, as we
      will create the VRF IP reservation on creation if it does not exist. The Metal IP and Customer
      IP must be IPs from this subnet. For /30 subnets, the network and broadcast IPs cannot be used
      as the Metal or Customer IP.
