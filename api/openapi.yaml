    \nMost of the endpoints in the API require authentication. Authenticating is done\
    \ with an authentication token in the X-Auth-Token header.\n\n```\ncurl -H 'X-Auth-Token:\
    \ my_authentication_token'\n```\n\nAuthentication tokens are used to identify\
    \ the user your application is connecting to the API on behalf of. Think of authentication\
    \ tokens as permanent sessions—the user creates authentication tokens, and your\
    \ app can use them to connect to the API on their behalf until they delete the\
    \ token.\n\n"

- description: "The Equinix Metal API uses a few methods to minimize network traffic\
    \ and bandwidth:\n\n`include`\n\nFor resources that contain collections of other\
    \ resources, the Equinix Metal API will return links to the other resources by\
    \ default.\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  // Includes \"href\" links if the resource\
    \ is reachable through the API.\n  \"projects\": [\n    { \"href\": \"/projects/5b590e4f-be96-4400-ae32-c315ee67964d\"\
    \ },\n    { \"href\": \"/projects/f3f131c8-f302-49ef-8c44-9405022dc6dd\" }\n \
    \ ],\n  // Includes \"id\" attributes if not.\n  \"emails\": [\n    { \"id\":\
    \ \"eb5d8c89-4d15-4c87-859c-5ae190ad5d9a\" },\n    { \"id\": \"c17f77ad-9070-4084-abaa-7538581d9523\"\
    \ }\n  ]\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you're interested in acting on resources\
    \ in the projects collection, it doesn't make sense to make a separate API call\
    \ to retrieve each project. Instead, you can specify which collections you'd like\
    \ to be included using the include parameter.\n\n```\n/user?include=projects\n\
    ```\nwill return\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"projects\": [\n    {\n      \"href\"\
    : \"/projects/c851d3c5-d55d-4b1a-99f1-96fc64768bc3\",\n      \"id\": \"c851d3c5-d55d-4b1a-99f1-96fc64768bc3\"\
    ,\n      \"name\": \"Project 1\",\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      \"href\": \"\
    /projects/21f8e88b-bd4e-44ca-b956-4f3f88e6e5f2\",\n      \"id\": \"21f8e88b-bd4e-44ca-b956-4f3f88e6e5f2\"\
    ,\n      \"name\": \"Project 2\",\n      ...\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nThe\
    \ `include` parameter is accepted for all `GET` requests on all resources and\
    \ collections, and should be specified as a comma-separated list.\n\n```\n/user?include=emails,projects,memberships\n\
    ```\n\nYou may also include nested associations up to 3 levels deep using dot\
    \ notation:\n\n```\n/user?include=memberships.projects\n```\n"

- description: "Equinix Metal uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the\
    \ success or failure of an API request.\n\nIn general: Codes in the 2xx range\
    \ indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given\
    \ the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed,\
    \ etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Equinix Metal's servers\
    \ (these are rare).\n\n| Code                               | Summary\n| ----------------------------------\

    \ wrong on Equinix Metal's end. (These are rare.)\n\nErrors (4xx, 5xx) reported\
    \ by the API will include a JSON error response.  This response will be structured\
    \ as one of the following:\n\n```json\n{\"error\": \"the error message\"}\n```\n\
    \nor\n\n```json\n{\"errors\": [\"one error\", \"another error\"}\n```\n\nThe JSON\

        \nType-specific options (such as operating_system for baremetal devices) should\
        \ be included in the main data structure alongside hostname and plan.\n\n\
        The features attribute allows you to optionally specify what features your\
        \ server should have.\n\nFor example, if you require a server with a TPM chip,\
        \ you may specify `{ \"features\": { \"tpm\": \"required\" } }` (or `{ \"\
        features\": [\"tpm\"] }` in shorthand).\n\nThe request will fail if there\
        \ are no available servers matching your criteria. Alternatively, if you do\
        \ not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server\
        \ with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature\
        \ with a preferred value (see the example request below).\n\nThe request will\
        \ not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory.\n\nThe\
        \ facilities attribute specifies in what datacenter you wish to create the\
        \ device.\n\nYou can either specify a single facility `{ \"facility\": \"\
        f1\" }` , or you can instruct to create the device in the best available datacenter\
        \ `{ \"facility\": \"any\" }`. Additionally it is possible to set a prioritized\
        \ location selection.\n\nFor example `{ \"facility\": [\"f3\", \"f2\", \"\
        any\"] }` will try to assign to the facility f3, if there are no available\
        \ f2, and so on. If \"any\" is not specified for \"facility\", the request\
        \ will fail unless it can assign in the selected locations.\n\nWith `{ \"\
        facility\": \"any\" }` you have the option to diversify to indicate how many\
        \ facilities you are willing to be spread across. For this purpose use parameter:\
        \ `facility_diversity_level = N`.\n\nFor example:\n\n`{ \"facilities\": [\"\
        sjc1\", \"ewr1\", \"any\"] ,  \"facility_diversity_level\" = 1, \"quantity\"\
        \ = 10 }` will assign 10 devices into the same facility, trying first in \"\
        sjc1\", and if there aren’t available, it will try in  \"ewr1\", otherwise\
        \ any other.\n\nThe `ip_addresses` attribute will allow you to specify the\
        \ addresses you want created with your device.\n\nTo maintain backwards compatibility,\
        \ If the attribute is not sent in the request, it will be treated as if `{\
        \ \"ip_addresses\": [{ \"address_family\": 4, \"public\": true }, { \"address_family\"\
        : 4, \"public\": false }, { \"address_family\": 6, \"public\": true }] }`\
        \ was sent.\n\nThe private IPv4 address is required and always need to be\
        \ sent in the array. Not all operating systems support no public IPv4 address,\
        \ so in those cases you will receive an error message.\n\nFor example, to\
        \ only configure your server with a private IPv4 address, you can send `{\
        \ \"ip_addresses\": [{ \"address_family\": 4, \"public\": false }] }`.\n\n\
        Note: when specifying a subnet size larger than a /30, you will need to supply\
        \ the UUID(s) of existing ip_reservations in your project to assign IPs from.\n\
        \nFor example, `{ \"ip_addresses\": [..., {\"address_family\": 4, \"public\"\
        : true, \"ip_reservations\": [\"uuid1\", \"uuid2\"]}] }`\n\nTo access a server\
        \ without public IPs, you can use our Out-of-Band console access (SOS) or\
        \ use another server with public IPs as a proxy."

        \ you to optionally specify what features your server should have. For example,\
        \ if you require a server with a TPM chip, you may specify `{ \"features\"\
        : { \"tpm\": \"required\" } }` (or `{ \"features\": [\"tpm\"] }` in shorthand).\n\
        \nThe request will fail if there are no available servers matching your criteria.\
        \ Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer\
        \ to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you\
        \ may specify that feature with a preferred value (see the example request\
