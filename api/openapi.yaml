    # Introduction
    Equinix Metal provides a RESTful HTTP API which can be reached at <https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1>. This document describes the API and how to use it.

    The API allows you to programmatically interact with all
    of your Equinix Metal resources, including devices, networks, addresses, organizations,
    projects, and your user account. Every feature of the Equinix Metal web interface is accessible through the API.

    The API docs are generated from the Equinix Metal OpenAPI specification and are officially hosted at <https://metal.equinix.com/developers/api>.

    # Common Parameters

    The Equinix Metal API uses a few methods to minimize network traffic and improve throughput. These parameters are not used in all API calls, but are used often enough to warrant their own section. Look for these parameters in the documentation for the API calls that support them.

    ## Pagination

    Pagination is used to limit the number of results returned in a single request. The API will return a maximum of 100 results per page. To retrieve additional results, you can use the `page` and `per_page` query parameters.

    The `page` parameter is used to specify the page number. The first page is `1`. The `per_page` parameter is used to specify the number of results per page. The maximum number of results differs by resource type.

    ## Sorting

    Where offered, the API allows you to sort results by a specific field. To sort results use the `sort_by` query parameter with the root level field name as the value. The `sort_direction` parameter is used to specify the sort direction, either either `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending).

    ## Filtering

    Filtering is used to limit the results returned in a single request. The API supports filtering by certain fields in the response. To filter results, you can use the field as a query parameter.

    For example, to filter the IP list to only return public IPv4 addresses, you can filter by the `type` field, as in the following request:

    ```sh
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token' \
      https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/projects/id/ips?type=public_ipv4
    ```

    Only IP addresses with the `type` field set to `public_ipv4` will be returned.

    ## Searching

    Searching is used to find matching resources using multiple field comparissons. The API supports searching in resources that define this behavior. Currently the search parameter is only available on devices, ssh_keys, api_keys and memberships endpoints.

    To search resources you can use the `search` query parameter.

    ## Include and Exclude

    For resources that contain references to other resources, sucha as a Device that refers to the Project it resides in, the Equinix Metal API will returns `href` values (API links) to the associated resource.

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "project": {
        "href": "/metal/v1/projects/f3f131c8-f302-49ef-8c44-9405022dc6dd"
      }
    }
    ```

    If you're going need the project details, you can avoid a second API request.  Specify the contained `href` resources and collections that you'd like to have included in the response using the `include` query parameter.

    For example:

    ```sh
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token' \
      https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/user?include=projects
    ```

    The `include` parameter is generally accepted in `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests where `href` resources are presented.

    To have multiple resources include, use a comma-separated list (e.g. `?include=emails,projects,memberships`).

    ```sh
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token' \
      https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/user?include=emails,projects,memberships
    ```

    You may also include nested associations up to three levels deep using dot notation (`?include=memberships.projects`):

    ```sh
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token' \
      https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/user?include=memberships.projects
    ```

    To exclude resources, and optimize response delivery, use the `exclude` query parameter. The `exclude` parameter is generally accepted in `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests for fields with nested object responses. When excluded, these fields will be replaced with an object that contains only an `href` field.

    Nearly all of the endpoints in the API require authentication. Authentication is performed by providing an authentication token (interchangeably referred to as an API key) in the `X-Auth-Token` HTTP request header.

    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

    User API keys can be obtained by creating them in the Equinix Metal Portal or by using the [Create a User API Key](#operation/createAPIKey) endpoint.

    Project API keys can also be obtained by creating them in the Equinix Metal Portal or by using the [Create a Project API Key](#operation/createProjectAPIKey) endpoint. Project API keys are scoped to a single project and can only be used to access resources within that project.

    For example, to use an authenticated API token, you would make a request like the following:

    ```bash
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token' \
      https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/user/api-keys
    ```

    Applications can take advantage of the Equinix Metal API and API keys to perform any of the actions that can be performed in the Equinix Metal Portal. For example, you can use the API to create and manage devices, projects, and other resources.

    API keys can be deleted without affecting any of the resources created with them. Access to applications using the API can be revoked by deleting the API key used to authenticate the application.

    Equinix Metal uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

    In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Equinix Metal's servers (these are rare).

    | Code                               | Summary
    | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------
    | 200 OK                             | Everything worked as expected.
    | 201 Create                         | Everything worked as expected, the resource was created.
    | 422 Bad Request                    | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
    | 401 Unauthorized                   | No valid API key provided.
    | 404 Not Found                      | The requested resource doesn't exist.
    | 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors | Something went wrong on Equinix Metal's end. (These are rare.)

    Errors (4xx, 5xx) reported by the API will include a JSON error response.  This response will be structured as one of the following:

    ```json
    {"error": "the error message"}
    ```

    or

    ```json
    {"errors": ["one error", "another error"}
    ```

    The JSON response is not guaranteed so check the HTTP status message. JSON may not be included if the error is reported by an API intermediary, like a loadbalancer service.

        This call can be used to un-assign an IP assignment or delete
        an IP reservation.

        Un-assign an IP address record.
        Use the assignment UUID you
        get after attaching the IP. This will remove the relationship between an IP and the device or metal gateway and will make the IP address available to be assigned to another device, once the IP has been un-configured from the network.

        Delete an IP reservation.
        Use the reservation UUID you get after adding the IP to the project. This will permanently delete the IP block reservation from the project.

        Creates a new spot market request.

        Type-specific options (such as operating_system for baremetal devices) should be included in the main data structure alongside hostname and plan.

        The features attribute allows you to optionally specify what features your server should have. For example, if you require a server with a TPM chip, you may specify `{ "features": { "tpm": "required" } }` (or `{ "features": ["tpm"] }` in shorthand).

        The request will fail if there are no available servers matching your criteria. Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature with a preferred value (see the example request below).

        The request will not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory.

            The features attribute allows you to optionally specify what features your server should have.

            ```
            { "features": ["tpm"] }
            ```

            Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature with a `preferred` value. The request will not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory. The API offers an alternative syntax for mixing preferred and required features:

            ```
            { "features": { "tpm": "required", "raid": "preferred" } }
            ```

            The request will only fail if there are no available servers matching the required `tpm` criteria.

            The `ip_addresses attribute will allow you to specify the addresses you want created with your device.

            The default value configures public IPv4, public IPv6, and private IPv4.

            Private IPv4 address is required. When specifying `ip_addresses`, one of the array items must enable private IPv4.

            Some operating systems require public IPv4 address. In those cases you will receive an error message if public IPv4 is not enabled.

            For example, to only configure your server with a private IPv4 address, you can send `{ "ip_addresses": [{ "address_family": 4, "public": false }] }`.

            It is possible to request a subnet size larger than a `/30` by assigning addresses using the UUID(s) of ip_reservations in your project.

            For example, `{ "ip_addresses": [..., {"address_family": 4, "public": true, "ip_reservations": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]}] }`

            To access a server without public IPs, you can use our Out-of-Band console access (SOS) or proxy through another server in the project with public IPs enabled.

            The datacenter where the device should be created.

            Either metro or facility must be provided.

            The API will accept either a single facility `{ "facility": "f1" }`, or it can be instructed to create the device in the best available datacenter `{ "facility": "any" }`.

            Additionally it is possible to set a prioritized location selection. For example `{ "facility": ["f3", "f2", "any"] }` can be used to prioritize `f3` and then `f2` before accepting `any` facility. If none of the facilities provided have availability for the requested device the request will fail.

        \ For Dedicated interconnections, as long as the Dedicated Port has been associated\
        \ to the Virtual Circuit and a NNI VNID has been set, it will turn to 'waiting_on_customer_vlan'.\
        \ For Fabric VCs, it will only change to 'waiting_on_customer_vlan' once the\
        \ corresponding Fabric connection has been found on the Fabric side. If the\
        \ Fabric service token associated with the Virtual Circuit hasn't been redeemed\
        \ on Fabric within the expiry time, it will change to an `expired` status.\
        \ Once a Metro VLAN is set on the Virtual Circuit (which for Fabric VCs, can\
        \ be set on creation of a Fabric VC) and the necessary set up is done, it\
        \ will turn into 'Activating' status as it tries to activate the Virtual Circuit.\

        \ 'active' status, the status will show 'changing_vlan' if a new VLAN has\
        \ been provided, or 'deactivating' if we are removing the VLAN. When a deletion\
        \ request is issued for the Virtual Circuit, it will move to a 'deleting'\
        \ status, and we will immediately unconfigure the switch for the Virtual Circuit\
        \ and issue a deletion on any associated Fabric connections. Any associated\
        \ Metro VLANs on the virtual circuit will also be unassociated after the switch\
        \ has been successfully unconfigured. If there are any associated Fabric connections,\
