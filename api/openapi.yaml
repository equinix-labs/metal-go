  description: "# Introduction\nEquinix Metal provides a RESTful HTTP API which can\
    \ be reached at <https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1>. This document describes the\
    \ API and how to use it.\n\nThe API allows you to programmatically interact with\
    \ all\nof your Equinix Metal resources, including devices, networks, addresses,\
    \ organizations,\nprojects, and your user account. Every feature of the Equinix\
    \ Metal web interface is accessible through the API.\n\nThe API docs are generated\
    \ from the Equinix Metal OpenAPI specification and are officially hosted at <https://metal.equinix.com/developers/api>.\n\
    \n# Common Parameters\n\nThe Equinix Metal API uses a few methods to minimize\
    \ network traffic and improve throughput. These parameters are not used in all\
    \ API calls, but are used often enough to warrant their own section. Look for\
    \ these parameters in the documentation for the API calls that support them.\n\
    \n## Pagination\n\nPagination is used to limit the number of results returned\
    \ in a single request. The API will return a maximum of 100 results per page.\
    \ To retrieve additional results, you can use the `page` and `per_page` query\
    \ parameters.\n\nThe `page` parameter is used to specify the page number. The\
    \ first page is `1`. The `per_page` parameter is used to specify the number of\
    \ results per page. The maximum number of results differs by resource type.\n\n\
    ## Sorting\n\nWhere offered, the API allows you to sort results by a specific\
    \ field. To sort results use the `sort_by` query parameter with the root level\
    \ field name as the value. The `sort_direction` parameter is used to specify the\
    \ sort direction, either either `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending).\n\n\
    ## Filtering\n\nFiltering is used to limit the results returned in a single request.\
    \ The API supports filtering by certain fields in the response. To filter results,\
    \ you can use the field as a query parameter.\n\nFor example, to filter the IP\
    \ list to only return public IPv4 addresses, you can filter by the `type` field,\
    \ as in the following request:\n\n```sh\ncurl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token'\
    \ \\\n  https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/projects/id/ips?type=public_ipv4\n```\n\
    \nOnly IP addresses with the `type` field set to `public_ipv4` will be returned.\n\
    \n## Searching\n\nSearching is used to find matching resources using multiple\
    \ field comparissons. The API supports searching in resources that define this\
    \ behavior. The fields available for search differ by resource, as does the search\
    \ strategy.\n\nTo search resources you can use the `search` query parameter.\n\
    \n## Include and Exclude\n\nFor resources that contain references to other resources,\
    \ sucha as a Device that refers to the Project it resides in, the Equinix Metal\
    \ API will returns `href` values (API links) to the associated resource.\n\n```json\n\
    {\n  ...\n  \"project\": {\n    \"href\": \"/metal/v1/projects/f3f131c8-f302-49ef-8c44-9405022dc6dd\"\
    \n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you're going need the project details, you can avoid a second\
    \ API request.  Specify the contained `href` resources and collections that you'd\
    \ like to have included in the response using the `include` query parameter.\n\
    \nFor example:\n  \n```sh\ncurl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token' \\\n\
    \  https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/user?include=projects\n```\n\nThe `include`\
    \ parameter is generally accepted in `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests\
    \ where `href` resources are presented.\n\nTo have multiple resources include,\
    \ use a comma-separated list (e.g. `?include=emails,projects,memberships`).\n\n\
    ```sh\ncurl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token' \\\n  https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/user?include=emails,projects,memberships\n\
    ```\n\nYou may also include nested associations up to three levels deep using\
    \ dot notation (`?include=memberships.projects`):\n\n```sh\ncurl -H 'X-Auth-Token:\
    \ my_authentication_token' \\\n  https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/user?include=memberships.projects\n\
    ```\n\nTo exclude resources, and optimize response delivery, use the `exclude`\
    \ query parameter. The `exclude` parameter is generally accepted in `GET`, `POST`,\
    \ `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests for fields with nested object responses. When excluded,\
    \ these fields will be replaced with an object that contains only an `href` field.\n"

    Nearly all of the endpoints in the API require authentication. Authentication is performed by providing an authentication token (interchangeably referred to as an API key) in the `X-Auth-Token` HTTP request header.

    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

    User API keys can be obtained by creating them in the Equinix Metal Portal or by using the [Create a User API Key](#operation/createAPIKey) endpoint.

    Project API keys can also be obtained by creating them in the Equinix Metal Portal or by using the [Create a Project API Key](#operation/createProjectAPIKey) endpoint. Project API keys are scoped to a single project and can only be used to access resources within that project.

    For example, to use an authenticated API token, you would make a request like the following:

    ```bash
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token' \
      https://api.equinix.com/metal/v1/user/api-keys
    ```

    Applications can take advantage of the Equinix Metal API and API keys to perform any of the actions that can be performed in the Equinix Metal Portal. For example, you can use the API to create and manage devices, projects, and other resources.

    API keys can be deleted without affecting any of the resources created with them. Access to applications using the API can be revoked by deleting the API key used to authenticate the application.

    Equinix Metal uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

    In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Equinix Metal's servers (these are rare).

    | Code                               | Summary
    | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------
    | 200 OK                             | Everything worked as expected.
    | 201 Create                         | Everything worked as expected, the resource was created.
    | 422 Bad Request                    | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
    | 401 Unauthorized                   | No valid API key provided.
    | 404 Not Found                      | The requested resource doesn't exist.
    | 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors | Something went wrong on Equinix Metal's end. (These are rare.)

    Errors (4xx, 5xx) reported by the API will include a JSON error response.  This response will be structured as one of the following:

    ```json
    {"error": "the error message"}
    ```

    or

    ```json
    {"errors": ["one error", "another error"}
    ```

    The JSON response is not guaranteed so check the HTTP status message. JSON may not be included if the error is reported by an API intermediary, like a loadbalancer service.

        Creates a new spot market request.

        Type-specific options (such as operating_system for baremetal devices) should be included in the main data structure alongside hostname and plan.

        The features attribute allows you to optionally specify what features your server should have. For example, if you require a server with a TPM chip, you may specify `{ "features": { "tpm": "required" } }` (or `{ "features": ["tpm"] }` in shorthand).

        The request will fail if there are no available servers matching your criteria. Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature with a preferred value (see the example request below).

        The request will not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory.

        features:
          description: |-
            The features attribute allows you to optionally specify what features your server should have.

            In the API shorthand syntax, all features listed are `required`:

            ```
            { "features": ["tpm"] }
            ```

            Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature with a `preferred` value. The request will not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory. The API offers an alternative syntax for mixing preferred and required features:

            ```
            { "features": { "tpm": "required", "raid": "preferred" } }
            ```

            The request will only fail if there are no available servers matching the required `tpm` criteria.

            public: true
          description: |-
            The `ip_addresses attribute will allow you to specify the addresses you want created with your device.

            The default value configures public IPv4, public IPv6, and private IPv4.

            Private IPv4 address is required. When specifying `ip_addresses`, one of the array items must enable private IPv4.

            Some operating systems require public IPv4 address. In those cases you will receive an error message if public IPv4 is not enabled.

            For example, to only configure your server with a private IPv4 address, you can send `{ "ip_addresses": [{ "address_family": 4, "public": false }] }`.

            It is possible to request a subnet size larger than a `/30` by assigning addresses using the UUID(s) of ip_reservations in your project.

            For example, `{ "ip_addresses": [..., {"address_family": 4, "public": true, "ip_reservations": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]}] }`

            To access a server without public IPs, you can use our Out-of-Band console access (SOS) or proxy through another server in the project with public IPs enabled.

            The features attribute allows you to optionally specify what features your server should have.

            { "features": ["tpm"] }
            ```

            Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature with a `preferred` value. The request will not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory. The API offers an alternative syntax for mixing preferred and required features:

            ```
            { "features": { "tpm": "required", "raid": "preferred" } }
            ```

            The request will only fail if there are no available servers matching the required `tpm` criteria.

            The `ip_addresses attribute will allow you to specify the addresses you want created with your device.

            The default value configures public IPv4, public IPv6, and private IPv4.

            Private IPv4 address is required. When specifying `ip_addresses`, one of the array items must enable private IPv4.

            Some operating systems require public IPv4 address. In those cases you will receive an error message if public IPv4 is not enabled.

            For example, to only configure your server with a private IPv4 address, you can send `{ "ip_addresses": [{ "address_family": 4, "public": false }] }`.

            It is possible to request a subnet size larger than a `/30` by assigning addresses using the UUID(s) of ip_reservations in your project.

            For example, `{ "ip_addresses": [..., {"address_family": 4, "public": true, "ip_reservations": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]}] }`

            To access a server without public IPs, you can use our Out-of-Band console access (SOS) or proxy through another server in the project with public IPs enabled.

            { "features": ["tpm"] }

            Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature with a `preferred` value. The request will not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory. The API offers an alternative syntax for mixing preferred and required features:

            ```
            { "features": { "tpm": "required", "raid": "preferred" } }
            ```

            The request will only fail if there are no available servers matching the required `tpm` criteria.

            The `ip_addresses attribute will allow you to specify the addresses you want created with your device.

            The default value configures public IPv4, public IPv6, and private IPv4.

            Private IPv4 address is required. When specifying `ip_addresses`, one of the array items must enable private IPv4.

            Some operating systems require public IPv4 address. In those cases you will receive an error message if public IPv4 is not enabled.

            For example, to only configure your server with a private IPv4 address, you can send `{ "ip_addresses": [{ "address_family": 4, "public": false }] }`.

            It is possible to request a subnet size larger than a `/30` by assigning addresses using the UUID(s) of ip_reservations in your project.

            For example, `{ "ip_addresses": [..., {"address_family": 4, "public": true, "ip_reservations": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]}] }`

            To access a server without public IPs, you can use our Out-of-Band console access (SOS) or proxy through another server in the project with public IPs enabled.

            These keys are added in addition to any keys defined by
              `project_ssh_keys` and `user_ssh_keys`.

            A list of UUIDs identifying the users
            that should be authorized to access this device (typically
            via /root/.ssh/authorized_keys).  These keys will also
            appear in the device metadata.

            The users must be members of the project or organization.

            If no SSH keys are specified (`user_ssh_keys`, `project_ssh_keys`, and `ssh_keys` are all empty lists or omitted),
            all parent project keys, parent project members keys and organization members keys will be included. This behaviour can
            be changed with 'no_ssh_keys' option to omit any SSH key being added.

            The userdata presented in the metadata service for this device.  Userdata is fetched and interpreted by the operating system installed on the device. Acceptable formats are determined by the operating system, with the exception of a special iPXE enabling syntax which is handled before the operating system starts.

            See [Server User Data](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/servers/user-data/) and [Provisioning with Custom iPXE](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/operating-systems/custom-ipxe/#provisioning-with-custom-ipxe) for more details.
