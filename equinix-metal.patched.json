Authenticating is done with an authentication token in the X-Auth-Token header.\n\n```\ncurl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token'\n```\n\nAuthentication tokens are used to identify the user your application is connecting to the API on behalf of. Think of authentication tokens as permanent sessions—the user creates authentication tokens, and your app can use them to connect to the API on their behalf until they delete the token.\n\n"

      "description": "The Equinix Metal API uses a few methods to minimize network traffic and bandwidth:\n\n`include`\n\nFor resources that contain collections of other resources, the Equinix Metal API will return links to the other resources by default.\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  // Includes \"href\" links if the resource is reachable through the API.\n  \"projects\": [\n    { \"href\": \"/projects/5b590e4f-be96-4400-ae32-c315ee67964d\" },\n    { \"href\": \"/projects/f3f131c8-f302-49ef-8c44-9405022dc6dd\" }\n  ],\n  // Includes \"id\" attributes if not.\n  \"emails\": [\n    { \"id\": \"eb5d8c89-4d15-4c87-859c-5ae190ad5d9a\" },\n    { \"id\": \"c17f77ad-9070-4084-abaa-7538581d9523\" }\n  ]\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you're interested in acting on resources in the projects collection, it doesn't make sense to make a separate API call to retrieve each project. Instead, you can specify which collections you'd like to be included using the include parameter.\n\n```\n/user?include=projects\n```\nwill return\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"projects\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"/projects/c851d3c5-d55d-4b1a-99f1-96fc64768bc3\",\n      \"id\": \"c851d3c5-d55d-4b1a-99f1-96fc64768bc3\",\n      \"name\": \"Project 1\",\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      \"href\": \"/projects/21f8e88b-bd4e-44ca-b956-4f3f88e6e5f2\",\n      \"id\": \"21f8e88b-bd4e-44ca-b956-4f3f88e6e5f2\",\n      \"name\": \"Project 2\",\n      ...\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `include` parameter is accepted for all `GET` requests on all resources and collections, and should be specified as a comma-separated list.\n\n```\n/user?include=emails,projects,memberships\n```\n\nYou may also include nested associations up to 3 levels deep using dot notation:\n\n```\n/user?include=memberships.projects\n```\n"

      "name": "Errors",
      "description": "Equinix Metal uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.\n\nIn general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Equinix Metal's servers (these are rare).\n\n| Code                               | Summary\n| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------\n| 200 OK                             | Everything worked as expected.\n| 201 Create                         | Everything worked as expected, the resource was created.\n| 422 Bad Request                    | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.\n| 401 Unauthorized                   | No valid API key provided.\n| 404 Not Found                      | The requested resource doesn't exist.\n| 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors | Something went wrong on Equinix Metal's end. (These are rare.)\n\nErrors (4xx, 5xx) reported by the API will include a JSON error response.  This response will be structured as one of the following:\n\n```json\n{\"error\": \"the error message\"}\n```\n\nor\n\n```json\n{\"errors\": [\"one error\", \"another error\"}\n```\n\nThe JSON response is not guaranteed so check the HTTP status message. JSON may not be included if the error is reported by an API intermediary, like a loadbalancer service.\n"

        "description": "Creates new devices in batch and provisions them in our datacenter.\n\nType-specific options (such as operating_system for baremetal devices) should be included in the main data structure alongside hostname and plan.\n\nThe features attribute allows you to optionally specify what features your server should have.\n\nFor example, if you require a server with a TPM chip, you may specify `{ \"features\": { \"tpm\": \"required\" } }` (or `{ \"features\": [\"tpm\"] }` in shorthand).\n\nThe request will fail if there are no available servers matching your criteria. Alternatively, if you do not require a certain feature, but would prefer to be assigned a server with that feature if there are any available, you may specify that feature with a preferred value (see the example request below).\n\nThe request will not fail if we have no servers with that feature in our inventory.\n\nThe facilities attribute specifies in what datacenter you wish to create the device.\n\nYou can either specify a single facility `{ \"facility\": \"f1\" }` , or you can instruct to create the device in the best available datacenter `{ \"facility\": \"any\" }`. Additionally it is possible to set a prioritized location selection.\n\nFor example `{ \"facility\": [\"f3\", \"f2\", \"any\"] }` will try to assign to the facility f3, if there are no available f2, and so on. If \"any\" is not specified for \"facility\", the request will fail unless it can assign in the selected locations.\n\nWith `{ \"facility\": \"any\" }` you have the option to diversify to indicate how many facilities you are willing to be spread across. For this purpose use parameter: `facility_diversity_level = N`.\n\nFor example:\n\n`{ \"facilities\": [\"sjc1\", \"ewr1\", \"any\"] ,  \"facility_diversity_level\" = 1, \"quantity\" = 10 }` will assign 10 devices into the same facility, trying first in \"sjc1\", and if there aren’t available, it will try in  \"ewr1\", otherwise any other.\n\nThe `ip_addresses` attribute will allow you to specify the addresses you want created with your device.\n\nTo maintain backwards compatibility, If the attribute is not sent in the request, it will be treated as if `{ \"ip_addresses\": [{ \"address_family\": 4, \"public\": true }, { \"address_family\": 4, \"public\": false }, { \"address_family\": 6, \"public\": true }] }` was sent.\n\nThe private IPv4 address is required and always need to be sent in the array. Not all operating systems support no public IPv4 address, so in those cases you will receive an error message.\n\nFor example, to only configure your server with a private IPv4 address, you can send `{ \"ip_addresses\": [{ \"address_family\": 4, \"public\": false }] }`.\n\nNote: when specifying a subnet size larger than a /30, you will need to supply the UUID(s) of existing ip_reservations in your project to assign IPs from.\n\nFor example, `{ \"ip_addresses\": [..., {\"address_family\": 4, \"public\": true, \"ip_reservations\": [\"uuid1\", \"uuid2\"]}] }`\n\nTo access a server without public IPs, you can use our Out-of-Band console access (SOS) or use another server with public IPs as a proxy.",
